/*enrollments table summarizes and stores the relationship between students and courses, 
including extra information like scores, fees, completion status, timestamps, etc.

Instead of storing everything in one massive table, we:
Keep students clean (only student info)
Keep courses clean (only course info)
Use enrollments to store:
which student took which course
how they performed
any extra attributes of that relationship
This avoids:duplication,inconsistency,messy updates
